# Type-Royale

A fast paced game where you type to clear words off your list and send them into other players' lists. 

Created with Node.js, React.js, state management with Redux, and Socket.io for real time communication between players.

# To play
Check out the live demo at https://type--royale.herokuapp.com/  (Note that you may need to wait a bit for the app to boot up)

- Create a game, then invite other players by clicking the "Invite Link" button, which will copy the link to your clipboard.
- Paste that link to any other players (or open up another tab and play against yourself just to see what it does).
- Once everyone has joined, the host (the person who created the game, and has a star by their name) should click "Start Game"
- Click on the input box that says "Type words here!" and type the words that show up in your list, followed by enter, to send them to your enemies!
